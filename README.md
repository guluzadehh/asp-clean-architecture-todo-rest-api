# Test Todo List Web Api using ASP.NET

I've tried to implement this app in Clean Architecture style.


Configure your <i>ConnectionString (Default)</i> to run the app.<br />
Also make sure to configure your databases according to Entities in Domain Layer.<br />
You can do it from <i>dacpac</i> file.


Repositories are implemented using Dapper and simple raw SQL queries.
